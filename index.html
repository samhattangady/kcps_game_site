      Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions is a cozy puzzle game about helping pirate ships do pirate things.<br/>
      <h3>Solve the Scenarios</h3>
Each puzzle is a hand-crafted scenario designed to highlight interesting emergent mechanics that exist within the simulations. You start off by placing commands on the simulation board, and then seeing how the ships behave.

Once the simulation starts, you cannot change the commands, so you have to figure out how the ships behave with commands and with each other.
<h3>Navigate Pirate Hazards</h3>
The simulations are full of ocean currents, icebergs and many more hazards. Learn how they interact, and how to use them to your advantage.
